# Firemyna

Firemyna speeds ups Firebase applications development by providing a solid foundation without locking into any particular framework.

## Why?

🏎️ **Quickstart** working on a project with sane defaults.

🤝 **Share code** between the web application and backend.

⚡️ **Lightning-fast** development server enabled by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

🌈 **Universal** - bring your own framework or use built-in presets for Next.js (coming soon), Remix (coming soon) [Astro](./examples/astro#readme), [Create React App](./examples/create-react-app#readme), or [Vite](./examples/vite#readme).
